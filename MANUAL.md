==Introduction==

Welcome to HSBNE!

Our space might be a little overwhelming at first, so we've created this manual as a rough guide to help you get the most out of the community we've created.

We hope that this guide will help you better understand how HSBNE is organized, answer common questions and provide direction on how to get the most out of the resources HSBNE has to offer.

This manual is a guide to all members of our community; from first-time visitors to founding members. Feel free to edit and contribute information to this guide. HSBNE is a dynamic space and we expect this guide to be as equally as dynamic.

If you have questions not addressed in this Manual, please also check our FAQ or email exec@HSBNE.org.


== About HSBNE ==

HSBNE is an open community workshop democratically operated by our membership. We are friendly community of tinkerers, makers, engineers, educators, scientists, artists, hackers and overall geeks. Anyone who is, aspires to be, or just wants to hang around smart, creative, friendly mad scientist maker/hackers is welcome at HSBNE! We've got lots of cool tools and equipment. We've got a lot of really bright and creative people. We like to work on (and show off) fun and challenging technical projects.

== HSBNE Culture ==

HSBNE strives to promote an open and welcoming culture. We like the fact that we're a public resource for the community. To keep this kind of openness in our community, it takes a little more effort in a social sense to keep things running smoothly. Being part of an open community can be a challenge sometimes. Try to display a little extra politeness, a little extra patience, a little extra cleanliness and a little extra friendliness.

Our primary policy is to "Be Excellent to Eachother."  If you're not being excellent to your other members, expect to get called out for it.  And if you don't know whether or not something you're doing is excellent, odds are, it isn't.

We have also made a specific commitment in our Safe Space Policy to call out oppressive, discriminative or degrading behaviour, so please make sure to be aware of what you're saying and to whom.

== Organization ==

HSBNE is a non-profit organization. We collect dues from our membership to pay rent, utilities, insurance and maintenance of the space. Any funds left over are used for tools and consumables for HSBNE.

HSBNE has a 5 member Executive elected by membership. The Executive fulfill the roles required by Australian Incorporation law and oversee the operation of HSBNE. All of the executive are volunteers and are not compensated financially.  The executive can be contacted by emailing exec@hsbne.org.



== Regular Events ==

HSBNE has an Open Night every Tuesday at 5pm. This is best time to come by the space to find out what's happening and meet our community.

We keep a calendar of other upcoming meetings and events at http://hsbne.org.


== Health & Safety ==

Safety is the responsibility of each and every person at HSBNE. You are especially responsible for your own safety, but if you see others being unsafe, tell them!

It should go without saying, but if you don't know how to use a tool, don't use it! If you want to learn how to use a tool, ask around, and wait for someone to teach you!  If you're alone in the Hackerspace, it is advisable to refrain from using dangerous tools.

First aid kits are located in the Green Room, next to the light switch (on the shelf with all the safety goggles). There are additional first aid kits in the shed.  Fire extinguishers are littered throughout the space.  Make yourself aware of the location of fire extinguishers, they should all be in plain sight.

*There are three breaker boxes in the hackerspace.
**In the main building this is in the room between the Member Storage and the Green Room.
** In the Boneyard/Lab building it is in the room on the far right room as you're facing it from the quad.
** Finally, in the big shed it is in the middle room. This should never need to be used as it supplies power to the entire site and turning it off needlessly will make us unpopular with the landlord/lady.


== Children ==

HSBNE is a dynamic space with potential hazards requiring a mature attitude towards safety. Due to the nature of this environment (and the extra precaution required) unattended minors under the age of 18 are prohibited from HSBNE, except when accompanied by a legal guardian at all times.

Although HSBNE allows accompanied minors, keep in mind that we do not make any effort to maintain a kid-friendly environment.

== Consumables ==

For most activities, you should plan to bring your own consumables.  HSBNE has an ample supply of basic needs, but anything large or specialized will not likely be found at the space.

All parts in the parts containers on the wall in the Green room are free.  There is a sign marking them as free.  These drawers contain resistors, capacitors, LEDs, and some semiconductors.  The drawers are labeled, and contain items such as tape, glue, zip-ties, soldering equipment, hot-glue.

Items in the boneyard are also free.

There is a parts store located in the vending machine.  Eventually this will be a web-connected store.

Drinks are located in the vending machines in the Green Room and ihe big Shed.  Prices are $1 in the Green Room and in the Shed.


== Donations ==

HSBNE is a non-profit, and will accept your donations of equipment or money.  We accept all electronic and electromechanical equipment, except CRT monitors, or items containing CRT monitors.  Donations should be made to HSBNE Inc.  For more details on the rules of donations, see the Donations page.  If you have any questions, contact exec@HSBNE.org


== Tools ==
HSBNE has a variety of tools that all have a home that they should return to so that members can find them after you're done. Additionally there are a number of specialist tools that can be particularily dangerous if used incorrectly and require induction before use. These will have a QR Barcode on them linking to the wiki page with more info on how to get inducted and various training materials.

== Storage ==

You're only allowed to store items at the space on a semi-permanent basis if you're a member. Each member is provided a tub upon joining and you can purchase additional tubs at $20 each.

Please be conscious of our limited space, and only store items that you will use.


== The Space ==

HSBNE consists of about 6000 square feet of work area, of which about 2000 square feet is climate controlled.

=== Green Room Building ===

The Green Room Building also contains the lounge area, kitchen and bathrooms.  Most of the action at HSBNE takes place here, including most meetings, classes, and general work activity.  This area contains the repraps, laser cutter, and most hand tools.

=== Games Area ===

The games area includes couches, game consoles, several TVs and a refurbished MAME cabinet loaned to us by Lionel (Thanks Lionel!)

=== Kitchen ===

The kitchen includes a stove, sink, counter space, two microwaves (one for non-edibles!), cabinets, and a fridge.  Feel free to use this equipment to cook delicious food but please make sure to clean up after yourself using the provided dishwasher.

=== Bathrooms ===

Bathrooms should be self-explanatory.  Supplies for the bathrooms are located on the shelves in the Server Room, or in the breaker room next to the hot water system.


=== Members Storage ===

The room opposite the classroom (on your left as you come through the door) is used for member storage, access is logged so we can attempt to track missing items but we cannot 100% guaruntee their security. Please make sure to close the door after you.

=== Boneyard ===
The boneyard is in the second office-like building, filled with all sorts of wonderful recyclable things. Please make sure to clean up after yourself in here!

=== Wood Shop ===

The wood shop contains many woodworking tools, including two tablesaws, a compound saw and various woodworking tools.

=== Metal Shop ===

The metal shop includes a huge turret mill, two lathes of varying sizes, and general metalworking equipment (linishers etc).

== Guests ==

Tuesday night is the best time to drop by to have a look at the space and meet its members as this is when we have our open nights. We don't limit you on the number of times you can visit on the open nights but ask that you are honestly making any benefit from open nights that you sign up as a member.

== Guide to HSBNE culture ==
*Above all else, be excellent to each other.
*Fun is the prime directive. Keep things fun.
**All people like to be around things that are fun.
**All people tend to avoid things and events that are not fun.
**Therefore the best way to keep attendance and occupancy up is to keep things fun.
*Fair Warning: Using the collective 'we' or 'we should' can quickly get you deputized.
**This is meant to be a playful way of avoiding 'diffusion of responsibility'. Sometimes when people say "We should _________!", what they really mean is "Someone besides myself should _________!"
**Being deputized doesn't mean you have to do it yourself. But, it does mean you should lead the charge, find people to help you, and cajole them as necessary (free beer or home-baked cookies) to make it happen.
*When scheduling something; pick an arbitrary date to start negotiations, thereby avoiding arbitrary non-starting negotiations.
**Sometimes the hardest part of organizing is finding the 'best' time to do it.
**There is never a 'best time' that works for everyone.
**Once a date is set, everything else quickly falls into place.
*The less rules the better. Don't try to solve problems we don't have.
**We rely on a culture of openness, friendliness and mutual respect.
**If you have a conflict with some aspect of the space or a member, we expect you to try and resolve it with the member on a personal level first. If that is not achievable, then find a neutral member to help mediate the conflict.
** We do have a sports-like red/yellow card system. Carding is a last resort approach for conflict resolution and can result in termination of membership (If a members conduct is completely out of line, or if the card system is misused).

**Voting Rights (meetings)
